# High Issues

## H-1: Reentrancy: State change after external call

Changing state after an external call can lead to re-entrancy attacks.Use the checks-effects-interactions pattern to avoid this issue.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/WinningToken.sol [Line: 13](src/WinningToken.sol#L13)

	```solidity
	contract WinningToken is ERC20, ERC20Burnable, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/WinningToken.sol [Line: 34](src/WinningToken.sol#L34)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/RockPaperScissors.sol [Line: 2](src/RockPaperScissors.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```

- Found in src/WinningToken.sol [Line: 2](src/WinningToken.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/RockPaperScissors.sol [Line: 378](src/RockPaperScissors.sol#L378)

	```solidity
	    function tokenOwner() public view returns (address) {
	```

</details>



## L-4: Literal Instead of Constant

Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals. If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

	```solidity
	        require(_timeoutInterval >= 5 minutes, "Timeout must be at least 5 minutes");
	```

	```solidity
	        require(_timeoutInterval >= 5 minutes, "Timeout must be at least 5 minutes");

	```solidity
	            uint256 fee = (totalPot * PROTOCOL_FEE_PERCENT) / 100;
	```

	```solidity
	            uint256 fee = (totalPot * PROTOCOL_FEE_PERCENT) / 100;
	```

</details>



## L-5: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```

</details>



## L-6: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

	```solidity
